# PPE Usage Dataset

This repository provides the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Usage Dataset, designed for training deep neural networks (DNNs). The dataset was collected using the EFR32MG24 microcontroller and the ICM-20689 inertial measurement unit, which features a 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer.

The dataset includes data for four types of PPE: helmet, shirt, pants, and boots, categorized into three activity classes: carrying, still, and wearing.
